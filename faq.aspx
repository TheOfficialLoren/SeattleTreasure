    <h2>Freqently Asked Questions</h2>
<p class="bold">What is Seattle Treasure?</p>
<p>Seattle Treasure is a free Treasure Hunt.  Seattle Treasure hides different prizes throughout the city and periodically gives clues.</p>
<br /><br />
<p class="bold">What are the prizes?</p>
<p>Prizes vary from search to search. Initially Seattle Treasure is giving away cash 
    until it builds some parternships and develops some sponsors to give away 
    different prizes.</p>
<br /><br />
<p class="bold">Where are the hiding spots?</p>
<p>That is for you to figure out!  Prizes might be burried, in a crack of a building, or possibly an obvious spot visible to every person walking by.  Seattle Treasure will not put it's scavengers in danger, so don't go hanging over ledges or teetering I-5 medians.&nbsp; 
    Treasures are not in out of bound parts of parks or private property.&nbsp; 
    Please don&#39;t go looking for treasure in places that you shouldn&#39;t be in.</p>
<br /><br />
<p class="bold">What if I find the treasure?</p>
<p>The treasure will be hidden in an envelope or on a popsicle stick.  It will 
    contain a verification code.  Email the code to the SeattleTreasure.com and 
    prize will be arranged.</p>
