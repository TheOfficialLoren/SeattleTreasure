                    The adventure started on Saturday morning when my daughter asked me, "What park has both a reservoir and a museum?"  "Volunteer Park", I replied. "Why?"  Soon we were heading out to climb the water tower, a first for me.  The West Seattle view point was pretty simple - I drive by there when shopping in West Seattle.  But I'd never stopped.  If it hadn't had been for the rain, we would have lingered over the view.  Saturday's adventures ended at the International Fountain.  We nearly didn't get this one, but decided to look at the whales where Veronica had played as a little girl.  Sure enough, we found the clue and were ready for Sunday's trials.
<br /><br />
The Pike Place market clue was tough.  The market was packed, crowded with tourists buying crab and salmon.  We looked all over - nothing.  "Bummer" I said, and we headed home.  But after a hint, we headed back, driven by my wife.  Veronica and I dashed into the market, and finally found the little sign with the instructions.  After that, it was a dash to the car prowl park, where Veronica's sharp eyes found the clue.  Since I had grown up on Queen Anne, I know the view points and we hurried over.  At first I was thinking that we'd be searching Elliot Bay park - not a good thought in the rain.  But we looked down and saw the little playground at the other viewpoint.  Veronica looked over all the playground equipment while I looked in the rocks and around the edge.  "Hey Dad!", she shouted excitedly.  She had found the prize.

<br /><br />
What a great way to spend a fun weekend.  Thanks to Loren and Seattle Treasure for organizing this, and providing a great way to see the city and spend time together.<br />
